# Food-delivery-app


This project is a Streamlit-based web application that mimics the user interface of popular food delivery platforms. Designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, the interface incorporates modern web design elements such as responsive layouts, custom headers, promotional banners, and a dynamic navigation bar. The application combines the simplicity of Python with the power of HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons to create a smooth and interactive user experience. This project serves as a prototype for those interested in developing front-end interfaces for web applications using Streamlit.
